## Quick installation (for Linux!)

_To participate in competitions, or even organize your own competition, **you don't need to install anything**, you just need to sign in an instance of the platform (e.g. [this one](https://codalab.lisn.fr/)). 
If you wish to configure your own instance of CodaLab competitions, here are the instructions:_

Install docker and add your user to the docker group, if you haven't already

```
$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Clone this repo and get the default environment setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions
$ cd codalab-competitions
$ cp .env_sample .env
$ pip install docker-compose
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Now you should be able to access http://localhost/
